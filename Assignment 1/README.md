# Assignment1: Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement Simulation
Develop a simulation for a robot moving through a grid-based environment considering task optimization strategies and safety to ensure efficient travel, collision avoidance, and effective energy management. The simulation should manage the robot's energy levels and battery status, incorporating the necessity of recharging.
