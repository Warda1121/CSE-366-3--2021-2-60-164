# Assignment2: Robot Task Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm
The goal of this assignment is to develop and implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the
assignment of multiple robots to a set of tasks in a dynamic production environment. Your primary
objectives are to minimize the total production time, ensure a balanced workload across robots, and
prioritize critical tasks effectively. Additionally, you will create a detailed visualization to illustrate the final
task assignments, robot efficiencies, and task priorities.
