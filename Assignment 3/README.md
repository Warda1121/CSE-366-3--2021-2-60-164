**Dataset**
([Link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/brfgw46wzb/1))

The dataset contains 1006 leaf images grouped according to their nutritional deficiencies (Boron, Iron, Potasium, Calcium, Magnesium, Manganese, Nitrogen and others). CoLeaf dataset contain images that facilitate training and validation during the utilization of deep learning algorithms for coffee plant leaf nutritional deficiencies recognition and classification.
